<ol>
<li>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The theoretical natural frequency obtained is damped or undamped natural frequency?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The experimental natural frequency obtained is damped or undamped natural frequency?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What would be the effect on the natural frequency when a notch is cut on the cantilever beam?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Where the location of the notch would have effect on the natural frequency of the cantilever beam?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do you think the sensor weight would affect the natural frequency of the beam?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What is the affect of damping on the natural frequency? Could you tell whether the obtained natural frequency is damped natural frequency or undamped one?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What is the relationship between the damped and undamped natural frequencies?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do you think the natural frequency and the damping ratio would change if we consider subsequent consecutive free vibration amplitudes instead of first two amplitudes?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do you think the beam tightening at the support (i.e., the flexibility of support) would affect the natural frequency of the system?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What type of free vibration signal you would expect if the beam is given initial disturbance other than the free end (i.e., if the initial disturbance excites higher modes of vibration also)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How many distinct natural frequencies can exist for an &lsquo;N&rsquo; degree of freedom vibratory <span _mce_style="font-size: small;" style="font-size: small;">system?</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Is the frequency of a damped free vibration smaller or greater than the natural frequency of a system? Why?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What is the basic difference between the free responses exhibited by an under damped system and an over damped system?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A damped free oscillation amplitude is observed to be reduced to 20% of its initial amplitude in 100 complete cycles. Estimate the damping ratio.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What is the meaning of mode shape of a dynamic system?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Are mode shapes the same for different end conditions of the beam? How will be the first three mode shape of the simply supported beam?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What is the FFT plot and how can you measure the frequency from the graph?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What is the difference between the free vibration of a continuous cantilever beam and a cantilever beam which is modeled as single degree-of-freedom system?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If we change the mass and stiffness distribution of a beam then are there any changes in mode shapes of the beam? Are any changes in the locations of the first and second node due to this?</p>
</li>
